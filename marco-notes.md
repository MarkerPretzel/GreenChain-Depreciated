# Process
## Step 1: Create Users
- Create multiple users
- Give each user STX

## Step 2: Somehow begin the contract
- have a user create the contract

## Step 3: Let users contribute
- let each user contribute an amount
- track the amount each user adds and aggregate to total funds
- if a user has already added, aggregate to their total contribution
- assert that funds do not go over
- if funds reached, set funds reached to true and stop contributions

## Step 4: Operational Plant
- (opt) model an electricity meter over the course of x time
- as income for the plant comes in, divy it proportional to contribution
